  <h1>Chocolate Mousse</h1>
  <p>Yields: 8 servings</p>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Sweet Chocolate, 1/4 lb  </li>
    <li>Semi-sweet Chocolate, 1/4 lb  </li>
    <li>Eggs, 6 large  </li>
    <li>Water, 3 tbsp  </li>
    <li>Sweet liquer, 1/4 cup  </li>
    <li>Heavy cream, 2 cups  </li>
    <li>Whipped cream, for garnish   </li>
    <li>Grated chocolate, for garnish   </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Steps:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Break the chocolate into 1/2-inch pieces and place the chocolate in a saucepan in hot, almost boiling water and cover. Or use a double boiler if you have one. Let melt over low heat.</li>
    <li>Put the yolks in a heavy saucepan and add the water. Place the saucepan over very low heat while beating vigorously and constantly with a wire whisk. Experienced cooks may do this over direct heat. It may be preferable, however, to use a metal disk such as a Flame Tamer to control the heat. In any event, when the yolks start to thicken, add the liqueur (optional), beating constantly. Cook until the sauce achieves the consistency of a hollandaise or a sabayon, which it is. It is done when you run a rubber spatula down the middle of the pot and the sauce stays separated. Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Add the melted chocolate to the sauce and fold it in. Scrape the sauce into a large mixing bowl.</li>
    <li>Beat the cream until stiff, adding 2 tablespoons of the sugar toward the end of the beating. Fold this into the chocolate mixture.</li>
    <li>Beat the whites until soft peaks start to form. Beat in the remaining 4 tablespoons of sugar and continue beating until stiff. Fold this into the mousse with a large rubber spatula.</li>
    <li>Spoon the mousse into a crystal bowl or individual dishes and chill until ready to serve. When ready to serve, garnish with whipped cream and grated chocolate.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Notes:</strong>
