  <h1>Pizza Dough</h1>
  <p>Yields: 2 pizzas</p>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Active dry yeast, 2 grams  </li>
    <li>Tap water, 200 grams  </li>
    <li>Sugar, a pinch   </li>
    <li>00 flour, 153 grams  </li>
    <li>AP flour, 153 grams  </li>
    <li>Sea salt, 8 grams  </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Steps:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small mixing bowl, combine 200 grams of tap water with yeast and olive oil. Add a minuscule amount of sugar. Stir and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.</li>
    <li>Stir yeast mixture. Combine with dry ingredients. Knead by hand for several minutes. Place paper towel over bowl and let rise for 90 minutes at room temperature.</li>
    <li>Knead rested dough for several minutes. Cut into 2 equal halves with a sharp knife. Shape into balls. Place in tupperware with several pin holes in the lid facing outwards. Let rise in refrigerator for several days.</li>
    <li>Take dough out of refrigerator to reach ambient temperature before shaping.</li>
    <li>Place pizza stone in oven and set oven to its maximum heat.</li>
    <li>Flour surface with cornstarch. Flatten dough into a crust by rolling from the center of the dough outwards. Toss or alternate between rolling and tossing.</li>
    <li>Place pie on pizza peel and top.</li>
    <li>Cook pizza until bubbles in crust are blackened.</li>
  </ol>
  <strong>Notes:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Dough is best around the fourth day.</li>
    <li>Dough lasts for about a week.</li>
    <li>Use quality flour.</li>
    <li>Consistent yeast handling leads to consistent dough.</li>
    <li>Pay close attention to raising the yeast and evenly distributing them into the dough.</li>
    <li>Place near door of refrigerator during slow rise. The yeast prefer a slightly warmer environment than the fridge.</li>
    <li>For an immediate, but less tasty, dough the rise times can be reduced as much as needed.</li>
    <li>The higher the heat the better. If you can bake it at ~950F, do so.</li>
    <li>Most consumer pizza stones will crack above ~500F.</li>
    <li>A hot stone is critical for making a good crust.</li>
    <li>Placing a cold stone in a hot oven can crack them.</li>
    <li>Leave stone in oven to cool to reduce thermal fatigue.</li>
    <li>A cast iron pan can replace a pizza stone in a pinch.</li>
    <li>Use as little cornstarch as necessary if any.</li>
    <li>Dough will initially be wet before shaping.</li>
    <li>Toss to air dry and shape.</li>
    <li>Spin tossed dough in one direction per polarity.</li>
    <li>Avoid catching dough repeatedly in center.</li>
  </ul>
