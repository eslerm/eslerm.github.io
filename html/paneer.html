  <h1>Paneer</h1>
  <p>Yields: 12 servings</p>
  <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Milk, 8 cups  </li>
    <li>Lemon juice, 1/4 cup  </li>
  </ul>
  <strong>Steps:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring milk to the boil, stirring occasionally to prevent a skin forming on top.</li>
    <li>As the milk begins to rise in the pan, stir in lemon juice in the portion of 1 tablespoon to 2 1/2 cups milk.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Soft curds should separate from the light yellow whey.</li>
    <li>Strain through muslin. Let hang for at least 30 minutes, then press to remove as much moisture as possible.</li>
    <li>If it has to be very firm, weigh down and leave for some hours in a cool place. This is necessary when it is cut into cubes and cooked with vegetable dishes, such as in palak paneer.</li>
