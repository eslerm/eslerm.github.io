    <li>If not using pancetta or bacon, replace fat with 2 tbsp of olive oil.</li>
    <li>If not using carrot, add 1 tbsp of sugar with tomatoe sauce.</li>
    <li>Add dry or fresh basil, oregano, thyme, or parsley with tomato paste as desired.</li>
    <li>Come over here, kid, learn something. You never know, you might have to cook for twenty guys someday. You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it to make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil, you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine. And a little bit of sugar, and that's my trick. - Clamenza</li>
